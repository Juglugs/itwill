# itwill
An application to create and manage an enduring "Will" for your IT, Documents, Archives, and Passwords 

## Idea
I thought of an application that I haven't seen elsewhere (or at least not in mainstream use). Will you help me create it?
The idea is that of an enduring "will" which will become "live" when you become seriously ill, incapacitated or die.
Your itwill (I.T. Will, *obviously*) will give your digital and online assets to a person or persons of your choosing.

### How will it know when to mature?
My thought is that once you sign up for the service, itwill will periodically ask you to check in and review your go-live settings.

## Details

itwill will present your chosen person(s) with a note or video outlining your wishes, and optionally a goodbye message (make your last words count!) 

itwill will (optionally) give the named person(s):

- Logins for your devices
- Logins for your online services
- Logins for your cloud storage
- Master passwords for your password manager(s)
- Your browser history
- Your location history
